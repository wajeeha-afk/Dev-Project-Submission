# Dev-Project-Submission
Hello sir,
This project is made for Amazon Prime Users. They can watch their favourite movie (if it's available on prime) by just entering it's name when running the program. They can run the program by entering their account details in the configure.json file. 
For eg: node test.js Inception //It will play the movie Inception
I apologise for submitting the project late. I wanted to include scraping in this project by showing the title and sypnosis as the output. However, I was unable to do so. Hence, I got late and had to omit that part. You can still find the code that I tried in the comments. I'll keep working on it and if I am able to do it, I will post another updated file.
I certainly had fun making this. I would really appreciate if you can kindly review and guide me on how to improve this project.
Thanks a lot, sir.

sincerely,
Wajeeha
